# Bootcamp Challenge 1: Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn about how accessibility standards and search engine optimization can be improved through code refactoring. This was done by replacing non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements, as well as consolidating CSS selectors and properties. The codebase is now organized in a manner that will be easy for future developers to follow. Over the course of this project, I learned how to consolidate code without majorly impacting the output. This project will be continually improved as I learn more skills, including optimizing the viewing experience for any screen width.
